## Mass Murder Canada Cloudflare Worker

Looking to see if I can replace [ff](https://github.com/darron/ff) with a [Cloudflare Worker](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) using [D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/) in Golang using [workers](https://github.com/syumai/workers).

## TODO

- [ ] POC
- [ ] Is it worth it to finish all capabilities?
